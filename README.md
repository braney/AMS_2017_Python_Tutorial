# AMS_2017_Python_Tutorial

Files for the Python tutorial "Using Python as a Replacement for Shell" given by Bryan Raney at the AMS 97th Annual Meeting on Jan 24, 2017 in the session "Brief Python Tutorials Workshop".

The Ipython Notebook demonstrates the commands.  The 'tutorial.zip' file contains files to operate on.  Those files are not strictly necessary, but you will need to change the commands in the Notebook if you want to operate on different files.

The tutorial was written in Python 3.5 (Anaconda 4.2.0) on a Mac.  The `pwd` and `grp` stuff is probably Linux/Mac specific, but I think the rest should work in Windows, too.
